# Selected Classification Problems

## Include ✅

### Conceptual Problems

- **4.4**: Curse of dimensionality - essential intuition for ML systems
- **4.5**: LDA vs QDA comparisons - practical model selection skills
- **4.6**: Applied logistic regression - fundamental binary classification
- **4.8**: Model evaluation - real-world performance analysis

### Applied Problems

- **4.13**: Weekly dataset - complete ML workflow
- **4.14**: Auto dataset - end-to-end classification
- **4.16**: Boston dataset - open exploration (optional)

## Exclude ❌

Problems 4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.9-4.12, 4.15: Focus on proofs, theory, and basic programming.

## Rationale

Selected problems emphasize practical ML engineering skills needed for interviews and real-world work. Excluded problems cover theory and basic programming less relevant for experienced software engineers transitioning to ML.
