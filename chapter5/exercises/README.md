# Selected Resampling Methods Problems

## Include ✅

### Core Theory

- **5.3**: K-fold cross-validation concepts
  - Critical for model evaluation
  - Common interview topic
  - Directly applicable to daily ML work

### Essential Applied Problems

- **5.5**: Default dataset - validation set approach
  - Complete CV workflow
  - Model evaluation with real data
  - Multiple splitting strategies

- **5.7**: Cross-validation implementation
  - Hands-on LOOCV implementation
  - Practical logistic regression validation
  - Real dataset (Weekly)

- **5.8**: Cross-validation with simulated data
  - Model selection
  - Understanding overfitting
  - Statistical significance vs CV results

## Exclude ❌

- **5.1, 5.2**: Mathematical proofs and probability theory
- **5.4**: Theoretical standard deviation estimation
- **5.6**: Bootstrap standard errors - too theoretical
- **5.9**: Bootstrap for statistical inference - less relevant for ML engineering

## Rationale

Selected problems focus on cross-validation and model validation - critical skills for ML engineering. These concepts appear frequently in interviews and are used daily in ML workflows. Excluded problems emphasize statistical theory and mathematical proofs that, while important for statisticians, are less crucial for practical ML engineering work.

The chosen problems give hands-on experience with:

1. Model validation techniques
2. Cross-validation implementation
3. Model selection using CV
4. Working with real and simulated datasets
