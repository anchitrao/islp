# Exercise 5

## Part A

If the Bayes decision boundary is linear, we expect LDA to perform better on the training set, and by extension the test set. This is because LDA is naturally linear in nature, compared with QDA which may be more flexible than the actual data.

## Part B

If the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, then we expect QDA to perform better due to
