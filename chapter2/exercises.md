## Question 1
### Part a
Flexible. With a large sample size and a low prediction count, you have a lot of information to train a flexible method. The few number of predictors leads to a lower risk of overfitting the data. 

### Part b
Since you don't have many observations, choosing a inflexible method would provide you with better results as more information is stored in the model itself. 
### Part c
If this relationship between predictors and response is highly non-linear, a flexible method might be able to fit these abnormal relations better with enough data. 
### Part d
Non-flexible. High variance in error terms means that a flexible method may attempt to overfit to these errors. Sticking with a non-flexible method will have a greater chance of underaccounting for these errors. That being said, if the underlying real-world relation is more complicated, a non-flexible model would fail to capture these relationships.
